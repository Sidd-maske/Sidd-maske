#  Hi, I’m Sidd

**Data Analyst who cleans chaos, interrogates data, and turns numbers into stories that actually mean something.**

###  What I Do

* Slice through messy data with **Python**, **NumPy**, **pandas**
* Ask uncomfortable questions with **SQL**
* Build dashboards in **Power BI / Excel** that even non-tech folks can understand
* Apply **statistics & data analysis** to extract real insights, not cosmetic charts
* Plot with **Matplotlib** 

### ⚙️ My Toolbox

`Python` · `NumPy` · `pandas` · `Matplotlib` · `Statistics` · `SQL` ·
`Excel` · `Power BI` · `Data Analytics ` · `EDA` · `Visualization`

###  What I Believe

If the data is lying, I’ll catch it.
If the question is vague, I’ll make it precise.
If the result doesn’t help a decision, it’s just decoration.

###  Reach Me

If you want dashboards that speak and insights that matter, You’ll find me one click away !!!
